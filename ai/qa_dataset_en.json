    "In general, higher amounts may make sense when the asset shows a *stable trend and positive technical signals*, while during *volatility or uncertainty* it’s better to reduce exposure and keep some liquidity ready. Remember, capital management protects you as much as it allows growth.\n\nHowever, I cannot set the exact amount. The decision depends on your risk profile, objectives, and total available capital 💡.",
    "If analysis shows *clear trends confirmed by volume or positive sentiment*, it might make sense to consider a larger exposure, but always within prudent limits. Conversely, if the market is uncertain or shows divergences, it’s better to reduce the stake and wait for confirmation.\n\nThat said, I cannot provide an exact figure 😅. Evaluate your risk tolerance carefully and never invest more than you can afford to lose.",
    "When an asset is *consolidating or showing growing strength*, a moderate investment may make sense; if the market is sideways or sharply declining, smaller amounts are safer. The key is to adapt position size to current volatility 📊.\n\nUltimately, the final decision is yours: I can only guide reasoning, not choose the exact amount.",
    "A good approach is to increase the stake only when there are *multiple confirmations* (positive trend, favorable sentiment, solid fundamentals). If uncertainty or mixed signals prevail, it’s better to reduce risk or wait.\n\nHowever, I cannot tell you exactly how much to invest 😉. Carefully consider your goals, risk tolerance, and capital you can safely use.",
    "When the market shows *directional clarity* and the asset is supported by solid data, slightly increasing the position may make sense. If there are *contrasting signals or strong fluctuations*, proceed with small steps and keep part of your capital in reserve.\n\nIn any case, the choice is personal: I cannot decide the precise amount, but I can encourage investing responsibly and prudently 🙌.",
    "Higher amounts can make sense with *confirmed trends and coherent technical signals*, but even then, it’s important to diversify and not concentrate everything on a single asset. If the market is uncertain or sentiment is negative, it’s better to limit exposure.\n\nHowever, I cannot determine how much you should invest 😅. Use caution and plan your risk management strategy carefully."
